# TCP-Client-Server
University Project that simulates a (simple) server and a client.
The server is limited to one client at a time, and supports files transfer (within a limited bandwidth).
Additionally, it can also transfer an 'ls' command result to the client.

Most of the utils methods in 'common.h' and 'common.c' were written by my professor, Dr. Meyer Goldberg.
